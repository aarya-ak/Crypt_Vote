## Features

-  **Authentication :**  The system incorporates interactive authentication mechanisms, where users authenticate by entering a normal password after combining the visual cryptographic shares.
- **Automated Verification :** Visual Cryptography based authentication prevents bots and unauthorized access, ensuring only legitimate voters participate.
- **Anonymity :**  The system upholds voter anonymity by securely managing authentication and vote casting without exposing identities.
- **Encryption :** The system uses visual cryptography to encrypt user authentication data by splitting an image into two secure shares that reveal the original information only when combined.
- **Results :** Securely calculate and display the result in real time through the system’s encrypted backend, ensuring accurate and tamper-proof outcome reporting.
- **Admin Panel :** Allows administrators to manage voters, candidates, elections, news, voting status, and view real-time voting results. 
- **One Vote :** Each registered user is allowed to cast only one vote per election.
